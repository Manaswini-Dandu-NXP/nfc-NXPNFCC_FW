User need to check what is the FW version on the IC (How to check FW version: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/UG10068.pdf).
If FW version is 3.1.0, first update to version 3.1.8 and then to 3.2.x. Otherwise the IC will be corrupted without possibility to repair it.
If FW version is 3.1.8 user can directly update to 3.2.x (but downgrade to 3.1.0 is not allowed).
Be aware that when IC is on version 3.2.x there is no downgrade possible
